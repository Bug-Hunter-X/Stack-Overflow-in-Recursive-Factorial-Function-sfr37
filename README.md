This repository contains a simple Tcl program demonstrating a stack overflow error caused by uncontrolled recursion in a factorial calculation. The bug is in `factorialBug.tcl`, and a corrected version is provided in `factorialSolution.tcl`.  The error arises from the lack of an appropriate base case for the recursion, resulting in an infinite loop of recursive calls. The solution introduces a more robust base case handling, thus preventing the stack overflow.
